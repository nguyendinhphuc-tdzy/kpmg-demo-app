                "exampleResult": "Beyond Compliance: How the Next Wave of Tax Reform Will Reshape Corporate Strategy\n Subheadline: From global minimum taxes to carbon border pricing, tax is becoming a\n board-level lever for value creation-not just a cost to optimize.\n\nOpening Hook\n\nTax reform has crossed a tipping point. In the next 12-24 months, new rules-most notably\n the OECD's 15% global minimum tax and adjacent measures like carbon border pricing-will\n alter where profits land, how investment cases pencil out, and what \"good growth\" looks like.\n CEOs who treat these shifts as a strategic design problem, not a filing exercise, will set the\n pace. [oecd.org], [taxation-c....europa.eu], [taxation-c....europa.eu]\n\nTrend Analysis\n\n1) A global minimum tax changes the map.\n\nMore than 140 jurisdictions have endorsed the OECD/G20 Inclusive Framework's \"Pillar\n Two\" rules introducing a 15% effective tax floor for large multinationals (≥€750m revenue).\n The core mechanics-a qualified domestic minimum top-up tax (QDMTT), income inclusion\n rule (IIR), and undertaxed profits rule (UTPR)-aim to curb profit shifting and narrow rate\n differentials across jurisdictions. [oecd.org], [taxfoundation.org]\n\nImplementation is real, not theoretical. The EU's directive entered into force in December\n 2022 and requires Member States to apply Pillar Two from fiscal years starting in 2024 (IIR)\n and 2025 (UTPR), with many countries already live. [taxation-c....europa.eu],\n\n[taxfoundation.org]\n\nWhat's the scale?\n\nOECD analysts estimate Pillar Two will add roughly US\\$155-192 billion in annual corporate\n tax revenues and cut low-taxed profits by ~80%, with incentives to shift profit reduced by\n about half. Independent assessments place potential global revenue gains in the\n\nUS\\$139-220 billion range-directionally consistent, though subject to design and uptake.\n [taxnews.ey.com], [oecd.org], [taxfoundation.org]\n\n2) The U.S. adds its own minimum tax lever.\n\nSeparately, the U.S. corporate alternative minimum tax (CAMT) imposes a 15% minimum\n based on adjusted financial statement income for groups with average annual income over\n US\\$1 billion, effective for years beginning after Dec. 31, 2022. Proposed regulations\n released in 2024 clarified scope, computations, and interactions with credits-making CAMT\n a parallel, complex regime for large filers. [eitc.irs.gov], [kpmg.com]\n 3) Carbon border pricing is moving into the core tax conversation.\n\nThe EU's Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM) shifts into its definitive phase in\n 2026, eventually requiring importers of carbon-intensive goods (steel, cement, aluminum,\n fertilizers, hydrogen, electricity) to buy certificates mirroring EU ETS carbon prices. The\n current transitional reporting period (2023-2025) is already influencing supply chains,\n product design, and sourcing. [taxation-c....europa.eu], [epa.ie]\n\n4) Tax administration is going digital-fast.\n\nTax authorities are standardizing data and moving toward real-time reporting. OECD surveys\n indicate widespread adoption of digital identity, APIs, and Al in administration-redefining\n the cost of non-compliance and the importance of tax-ready data architectures. [oecd.org],\n [kpmg.com]\n\nStrategic Implications for CEOS\n Risks to anticipate\n\nMargin compression & capital allocation drift: QDMTTs neutralize incentives to book income\n in low-tax jurisdictions; projects reliant on tax arbitrage may underperform under a 15% floor.\n Re-underwrite major capex and M&A theses with Pillar Two and CAMT overlays.\n [taxfoundation.org], [taxnews.ey.com]\n\nData, systems, and disclosure exposure: GloBE computations are jurisdictional and\n data-hungry. Misaligned ledgers and fragmented ERPs elevate compliance risk and finance\n costs as filings (e.g., Top-Up Tax Information Returns) centralize. [pwc.com], [oecd.org]\n Policy volatility across markets: EU rules are in force, but timelines differ elsewhere.\n Divergence on safe harbors, administrative guidance, and peer reviews raises the risk of\n double taxation or disputes. [taxation-c....europa.eu], [bdo.global]\n\nCarbon cost creep at the border: CBAM shifts embedded emissions into landed cost.\n Export-oriented segments and EU-bound supply chains face a structural cost of carbon\n absent decarbonization or verified foreign carbon pricing. [taxation-c....europa.eu],\n [law.georgetown.edu]\n\nOpportunities to seize\n\nRe-optimize footprint for real economics: With arbitrage dampened, capital should follow\n operating fundamentals-talent, infrastructure, proximity to demand-while QDMTTs keep\n more value in-market. Expect a premium on productivity and scale efficiencies.\n [taxfoundation.org], [europarl.europa.eu]\n\nTax-advantaged decarbonization: Aligning products and inputs to lower embedded carbon\n can reduce CBAM outlays and preserve EU market access. Embedded emissions\n transparency can also differentiate in tenders. [taxation-c....europa.eu], [epa.ie]\n Investor-grade tax transparency: Moving early on Pillar Two disclosures and CAMT impacts\n can reduce controversy, strengthen credit and ESG narratives, and pre-empt regulatory\n queries. [ey.com], [dart.deloitte.com]\n\nData as a competitive asset: Building tax-ready data pipelines (legal entity, CbCR, ETR by\n jurisdiction) improves forecast accuracy and accelerates scenario planning across pricing,\n sourcing, and portfolio moves. [oecd.org], [taxathand.com]\n\nWhat CEOs Should Do Now (Next 180 Days)\n\nStand up a cross-functional \"Pillar Two + CAMT\" control tower.\n\nBring together Tax, Finance, Legal, Supply Chain, and Sustainability. Mandate a single\n source of truth for entity-by-entity effective tax rates and safe harbor eligibility (e.g.,\n transitional CbCR). [dart.deloitte.com], [oecd.org]\n\nRe-underwrite your top 10 value drivers.\n\nRefresh IRRs for major investments and acquisitions under a post-arbitrage world. Include\n CBAM in landed-cost models for EU-bound flows and price scenarios using ETS-linked\n certificate ranges. [taxation-c....europa.eu], [law.georgetown.edu]\n\nEngineer for filing certainty, not heroics.\n\nDesign processes to meet emerging central filing gateways (e.g., EU DAC9 for top-up tax\n information returns) and reduce duplicative country filings. Invest in data lineage and\n controls now-before audits begin. [pwc.com], [loyensloeff.com]\n\nLink tax and climate strategy.\n\nWhere exposure is material, prioritize suppliers with verifiable emissions data, renegotiate\n carbon pass-through terms, and align internal carbon pricing with CBAM trajectory.\n [taxation-c....europa.eu], [epa.ie]\n\nCommunicate with markets.\n\nUpdate guidance on effective tax rate sensitivity, disclose governance around Pillar Two and\n CAMT, and articulate how your footprint strategy adapts under the new rules. Investors\n reward clarity in periods of reform. [ey.com]\n\nKPMG's Perspective\n\nIn our work with global enterprises, the companies that outperform treat tax reform as a\n design constraint for strategy-embedding GloBE and carbon rules into capital allocation,\n operating model choices, and data architecture-rather than chasing relief jurisdiction by\n jurisdiction. We help leadership teams translate evolving rules into practical playbooks,\n underpinned by investor-grade data and scenario modeling. (Advisory support varies by\n jurisdiction and is provided by KPMG member firms.) [kpmg.com]\n\nClosing Call-to-Action\n\nTax reform is not a footnote to your earnings call it is a structural shift in how and where\n value accrues. The winning CEO agenda: rebalance the portfolio for real economics,\n hard-wire tax-ready data, and make carbon cost visible in every decision.
